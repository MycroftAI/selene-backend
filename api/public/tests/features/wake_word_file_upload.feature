  Scenario: Device sends wake word audio file
    When the device uploads a wake word file
    Then the request will be successful
    And the audio file is saved to a temporary directory
    And a reference to the sample is stored in the database

   Scenario: Device sends wake word file for an unknown wake word
    When the device uploads a wake word file for an unknown wake word
    Then the request will be successful
    And the audio file is saved to a temporary directory
    And a reference to the sample is stored in the database

  Scenario: Device sends wake word file with non-unique hash value
    When the hash value of the file being uploaded matches a previous upload
    And the device uploads a wake word file
    Then the request will be successful

"""Endpoint to generate a pairing code and return it to the device.

The response returned to the device consists of:
    code: A six character string generated from a limited set of characters
        (ACEFHJKLMNPRTUVWXY3479) chosen to be easily distinguished when
        spoken or viewed on a deviceâ€™s display.

    expiration: An integer representing the number of seconds in a day,
        which is the amount of time until a pairing code expires.

    state: A string generated by the device using uuid4. Used by device to
        identify the pairing session.

    token: A SHA512 hash of a string generated by the API using uuid4.
        Used by the API as a unique identifier for the pairing session.

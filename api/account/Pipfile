# Version 1.0 of flask required because later versions do not allow lists to be passed as API repsonses.  The Google
# STT endpoint passes a list of transcriptions to the device.  Changing this to return a dictionary would break the
# API's V1 contract with Mycroft Core.
#
# To make flask 1.0 work, older versions of itsdangerous, jinja2, markupsafe and werkszeug are required.
